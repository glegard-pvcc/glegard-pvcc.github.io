            <td> <ul> Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended </ul> 
                 <ul> Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together </ul> 
                 <ul> Unit testin: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest 
                    testable component of an application </ul> 
                 <ul> Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. 
                    Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions </ul>
                 <ul> Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, 
                    is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions </ul>
                 <ul> Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used 
                    to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test </ul>
                 <ul> Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of 
                    non-functional testing </ul>
                 <ul> Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task </ul> </td>

            <td> Testing best practices: </td>
            <td> <ul> Continous testing - collaboration over the entire course of the porject with the to accelerate 
                software delivery while balancing cost, quality, and risk. With this testing technique, 
                teams donâ€™t need to wait for the software to be built before testing starts, 
                they can run tests much earlier in the project development to find bugs sooner </ul> 
                 <ul> Configuration management - prganizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. 
                    Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts 
                    and test results. Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet 
                    compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort </ul> 
                 <ul> Service virtualization -  testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. 
                    Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed,
                     enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can reuse, deploy and change 
                     a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment </ul> 
                 <ul> Defect or "bug tracking" -  monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and 
                    improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.
                    Metrics and reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share </ul> 
                 <ul> Metrics and reporting - reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Advanced tools 
                    integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard. Teams quickly see the overall 
                    health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements
