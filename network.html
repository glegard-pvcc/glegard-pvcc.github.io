                    regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities </ul> 
                 <ul> tier 3: Tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs are essentially networks of routers that collectively
                    provide the Internet’s communication infrastructure. The many possible pathways between routers gives this core of the Internet redundancy, meaning
                    that most or all of the network remains connected even when very important
                    tier-1 routers fail. Access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary
