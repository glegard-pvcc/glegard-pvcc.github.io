<h2> What was Obergefell v. Hodges? </h2> 
Obergefell v. Hodges was a Supreme Court case in regards to same-sex marriage and the Fourteenth
Amendment. James Obergefell and petitioners argued to Richard Hodges of the Ohio Department of
Health 
<br>
that denying them their right of marriage violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights.

<h2> The Journey of the Case </h2>
Before this case, 13 states had bans on same-sex marriage. James Obergefell and 15 other petitioners
from same-sex couples, from the states  of Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, and Kentucky, all filed suits 
to their states <br> Federal District Court claiming they were having their
constitutional rights violated by preventing them from marrying who they wish. They claimed that
the states 1) would not allowed them to marry someone of the same <br>
sex in their own state and this violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses in the 
Fourteenth Amendment and 2) they wouldnot recognize marriages performed in states where same-sex 
marriages were protected, <br> also violating their constitutional rights. In all four cases of 
the four states mentioned, the trial courts agreed with the plaintiffs. When it went to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals, it was reversed, and they said the marriage refusal was <br> not in violation of 
their constitutional rights and that it was a states issue. Then, the issue went to the Supreme Court,
with Justices Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

<h2> Result </h2>
The Supreme Court came to a 5-4 ruling of the plaintiffs, saying that the Fourteenth Amendment protects
and guarantees all their right to marry no matter the case. During the ruling, Justices Scalia, Thomas,
Alito, and Chief Justice <br> Roberts voted that the prevention of marriage was not a violation of 
constitutional rights, and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan voted in favor of the 
plaintiffs, with Justice Kennedy breaking the tie, saying their Due <br> Process and Equal Protection
was violated. Chief Justice Roberts then wrote a dissent saying that same-sex marriage could be fair
and beneficial, but that it is not protected by the Consitution. He says it should not be up to his 
court <br> to decide and is at the liberties of the States themselves. Justice Scalia joined in the 
dissent saying that those in the majority rule overstepped the Supreme Court's power and were acting
in a legislative manner rather than a judicial <br> one. Justice Thomas also joined the dissent saying
that the consensus distorted the democratic process and stretched due process and that they were taking
power from the legislature by infringing on religious freedom.
